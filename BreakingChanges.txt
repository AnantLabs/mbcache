--- BREAKING CHANGES ---

- TRUNK (compared to latest release) -
* A MbCache.Configuration.IProxyFactory needs to be provided when building the mbfactory. 
This removes the strong dependency to Castle and other proxy framework can be used.
* Move objects needed to create mbfactory to CacheBuilder ctor instead of its BuildFactory method.
