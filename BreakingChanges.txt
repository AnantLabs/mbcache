--- BREAKING CHANGES ---



- TRUNK (compared to latest release) -

* IProxyFactory.Name removed
* IMbCacheKey completely changed. 
* MbCacheKeyBase completely changed
* Some API changes how to invalidate types, objects and methods. See Wiki for current syntax.
* Removed ICacheFactory, instead an ICache is injected directly to CacheBuilder

- VERSION 0.6 -

* A MbCache.Configuration.IProxyFactory needs to be provided when building the mbfactory. 
This removes the strong dependency to Castle and other proxy framework can be used.
* Move objects needed to create mbfactory to CacheBuilder ctor instead of its BuildFactory method.
